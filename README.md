# OUR SOLUTION

Before the solution it all begins with a story and a simple idea.
The story is simple, the one who is in the primary industry and is using the ground water regularly is knowingly or unknowingly exploiting it. 
It is high time now we tell the world that one of the most important form of water resource is getting depleted exponentially.

We came up with this idea of an App for anyone who wish to explore how trends are changing across continents in ground water level and the associated reason.
WaterGo, so how does this app works? We wanted to explore the data but it was confusing at first with a lot of data floating everywhere online,
we scrapped everything we could starting from ground level indication from satellite, precipitation, frost and population nearby.
The User using the app can check if the land is sustainable for agriculture and what will be it's status in the near future
Concepts of deep learning helped us understand the trend of how global ground water levels have dramatically changed.

# FUTURE ASPECTS
* We plan to expand our app and make it more detailed. 
* Add maps which shows the ground water level over the next 10 years to make it more interactive and easy to use.
* Add a compare feature so that land owners and farmers can easily determine where to buy the land.
